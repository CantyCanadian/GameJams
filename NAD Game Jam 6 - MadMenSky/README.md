# Mad Men Sky
This game has been made during the 6th NAD Game Jam, Summer 2016, in Montreal. It was made with a team of 5 other members.
This is my first game jam using Unreal Engine 4, which was right after learning the basics in College. We used the Blueprint system as a replacement to raw programming due to the fact we were only 2 programmers.

Due to issues with the cooking and one of our script, we weren't able to prepare an executable for sharing. To try the game, just download it and press play. You can access a fully working main menu inside the 'Shit for Game Jam' folder.
